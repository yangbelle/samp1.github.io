    <h3 class="term">ABSOLUTE</h3>
    <div class="part">adj.</div>
    <div class="definition">
        Independent, irresponsible. An absolute monarchy is one
        in which the sovereign does as he pleases so long as he
        pleases the assassins. Not many absolute monarchies are
        left, most of them having been replaced by limited
        monarchies, where the sovereign's power for evil (and for
        good) is greatly curtailed, and by republics, which are
        governed by chance.
